statter
================
Originally this was intended to be a suite of tools for the sorting of baseball players based on any linear function over player peripherals and stats, both for pitchers and hitters.

Over time the idea evolved to be agnostic of the dataset, allowing sorting of an dataset over an arbitary set of features.

This application is written in Java with a MySQL backend and uses the jxml library for parsing datasets.

Future work will focus on developing the frontend and eventually release as a jetty web applcation.
